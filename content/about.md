## Hi! I'm John.

I am a Creative Technologist based in NYC, specializing in immersive installations, multimedia playback systems, and interactive visuals.

Coming from a background in environmental science, documentary filmmaking, and motion graphics, I have developed a unique passion for TouchDesigner and Interactive Technology.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'd love to hear from you!
