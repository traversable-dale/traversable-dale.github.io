## Overview

"[The Goethe-Institut New York](https://www.goethe.de/ins/us/en/sta/ney/ver.cfm?event_id=26362812) is pleased to present the first New York institutional exhibition featuring a temporary collective with Berlin-based artists Anna Ehrenstein and Sunny Pfalzer, and San Salvador-based artists Lucy Tomasino and Alexa Evangelista, in collaboration with Web-3 researcher, Josh Davila."

## Project Description

In December 2024, I began working with curator [Zach Feldman](https://www.zach-feldman.com/about/bio.html) to design a projector configuration for a retractable curved projection screen. Using floorplans of the space, and screen design from architect [Chloe Munkenbeck](https://chloemunkenbeck.cargo.site/), I designed a configuration that favored brightness, pixel density, and cost.

In February 2025, I led a team to install four ceiling-mounted projectors, and completed the projection mapping onto the 8.5m curved projection surface.

In addition to this, I programmed a custom back-of-house GUI in TouchDesigner to control content playback and system events. The content is being fed through MadMapper via NDI, and split to each projector with SDI-HDMI micro convertors.
