## Overview

Camata is "a self-directed film operated by a learning machine, a manifestation of an inhuman entity enacted upon by a set of robotic operators, performing a final rite of passage on a human skeleton found unburied in the Atacama Desert." - Marian Goodman Gallery

"Camata's live footage is the result of autonomous cameras decisions and is edited in real time. Sensors in the exhibition space capture a live human presence, disrupting its linearity." - MGG

## Project Description

My role in this project was to develop the back-end system responsible for real-time editing. I also worked on custom programming for on-site sensors that respond to human presence, enabling interaction between audience and system.

The system uses autonomous decision-making to create a constantly evolving film experience that responds to the presence and movement of viewers in the gallery space.
