## Overview

This project was an immersive installation made for the very last edition of [Shaker Mountain](https://ra.co/promoters/80563)- a 'smart house and techno in a family-and-friends setting on 250 acres of tree-topped mountain land' [Resident Advisor]

## Project Description

I was involved in technical direction, integration, and installation of this project, working directly with designer + lead fabricator [Shreya Patel.](https://barkframeworks.com/employee-owner-spotlight-shreya-patel/)

This project began with a question "what would you want to see at a music festival?" Shreya imagined something that people could sit underneath and enjoy a moment of peace within a hectic festival atmosphere.

*Flower structure detail*

We began thinking of a large suspended flower, similar to a conch shell, where holding your ear up to it would allow you to hear the ocean- instead you would hear the calls and chirps of tropical birds from a rainforest far away.
