## Project Description

Our team was asked to create 2 timeline-based video booths replicating moments from the Kodansha-produced anime classics.

I was responsible for replicating the compositions for both booths in TouchDesigner, as well as creating 2 functional GUIs for back-of-house monitoring and control. In addition to this, I was involved in the interactive development, installation, and monitoring of this project.
