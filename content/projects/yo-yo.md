## Project Description

My involvement in this project began in 2022 through Zion Jackson and THE OFFICE performing arts + film, and has continued under Sophie Shakleton and Sound Postings.

My responsibilities have included researching, arranging, and experimenting with images- as well as timeline editing and final video delivery. The video itself is designed to accompany the live musical performance and could be modified for a variety of audiences around the world.

*Images from Hubble and James Webb telescopes*

We began with images of our universe from the Hubble and James Webb telescopes, paying special attention to the visuals connections that emerge between the macro and micro world.

Soon after the first event in Paris, we began preparing an evolution of the sequence for another event in the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee. This sequence includes images from photographer [Austin Mann](https://www.austinmann.com/), and aimed to connect deeply with the specific region of the performance.

Beyond 2023, the performance travelled all over the world (in a variety of venues). Each time, we intentionally found new images that spoke to the geography of the region. This resulted in nearly a dozen unique sequences- all beginning with the universal patterns of outer space, but merging into the unique colors shapes of each place.
