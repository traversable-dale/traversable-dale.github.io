# My Website!!!

### WARNING :warning: WORK IN PROGRESS

Welcome to my simple, lightweight portfolio website made with Hugo and GitHub Pages. I am in the process of migrating all of my content over from my [webflow](johnsyzonenko.com) site.

Source and Console Theme: <br>
https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo <br>
https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/?tab=readme-ov-file <br>

If you'd like to make your own, file templates and the comprehensive startup guide are available in ```/ref```

Check out the WIP site [here](https://traversable-dale.github.io/) <br>

### {Testing...}

To launch and test locally, follow the startup guide and:


``` hugo serve -D ```
